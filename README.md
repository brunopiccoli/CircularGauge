# CircularGauge
Create Qlik Sense KPIs with this extension. It supports percentage (%) KPIs up to 300%. Great for showing target achievements with optional animation of values.

The extension is using the open source code from BrightPoint Consulting (slightly modified) from here:
http://www.brightpointinc.com/download/radial-progress-source-code/

I added two new themes and now it is possible to set the color of each arc manually.

New features:
- Choose from 100%, 200% or 300%
- Set a maximum measurement range
- Set a color manually based on an expression
